# Data Limitations and Ethics

The happiness factors: economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity are based on a Westernized idea of happiness and therefore may not reflect other cultures ideas of what it means. Culturally, happiness also means something different.  In Japan there is a cultural bias against boasting of one’s good fortune (Smith, K., 2017) Personal evaluation also varies, just like a pain scale, so a 4 for one person may be an 8 to another. It relies on subjective evaluation given as an ordinal number, trying to quantify a qualitative variable. 

# Data Relevance

The data was collected to help determine and form policy that would help increase well-being of the global population. This data is pre-pandemic, so the accuracy of it needs to be viewed in light of this factor.
